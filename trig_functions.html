      <h4>Visualization of Trigonometric Functions</h4>
      <hr />
      <p class="center-align">
        <b>
          Ever wondered why Trigonometric functions are named the way they
          are?<br /><br />
          Why is cosine named as "co"sine, "cosecant" named as "co"secant and
          "cotangent" named as "co"tangent?<br /><br />
          Do these functions have any meaning outside of triangles?<br /><br />
          Aren't terms like "secant" and "tangent" associated with circles?
        </b>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h5>The Age-old brothers:<br />Sine and Cosine</h5>
      <p>
        These two functions suffice to generate the rest of trigonometric
        functions.<br /><br />

        <b>Etymology:</b> The word "sine" is derived from the latin word "Sinus"
        which means a "bay" or a "fold". It's Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian
        versions are dervided from the Greek word "khorde" which signifies a
        bow-string. The below visualization helps us understand how this came
        about.<br /><br />

        <b>Visualization:</b> Consider a unit circle (a circle of radius 1).
        Consider a line drawn from the origin O, that makes an angle &theta;
        with the X-axis in the positive direction. This line intersects the
        circle at a point P. The length projection of the line segment OP on the
        Y-axis is equal to the Sine of &theta;.<br /><br />

                <input type="range" min="0" max="360" value="30" id="slider-1" onchange="update_1()" class="slider">

        </center>
        <br />
        
        <b>Relationship between Sine and Cosine:</b> 
        <p>
            Cosine has a serendipitous
        co-existence with Sine. The length of projection of the same line
        segment OP on the X-axis is equal to the Cosine of &theta;
        </p><br /><br />
        <b>Value of Sines and Cosines of multiples of 90 degrees:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>The Sine of 0 degrees is 0, since a line coinciding with the X-axis has no projection on the Y-axis</li>
            <li>The Cosine of 0 degrees is 1, since a line drawn within a unit circle and coinciding with the X-axis has a projection of length 1 on the X-axis</li>
            <li>The Sine of 90 degrees is 1, since a line drawn within a unit circle and coinciding with the Y-axis has a projection of length 1 on the Y-axis</li>
            <li>The Cosine of 90 degees is 0, since a line coinciding with the Y-axis has no projection on the X-axis</li>
            <li>The same logic holds good for 180 degrees and 270 degrees</li>
            <li>This visualization also allows us to extend the definition of trigonometric functions beyond 90 degrees, since we are no longer restricted to a triangle</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Signs of Sine and Cosine functions:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Any angle from 0 to 180 degrees has a positive Sine, since the length of projection on the Y-axis is measured along the positive Y-direction</li>
            <li>Sine is negative for rest of the angles because the length of projection on the Y-axis is measured along the negative Y-direction</li>
            <li>Any angle from 0 to 90 degrees and 270 to 360 degrees has a positive Cosine, since the length of projection on the X-axis is measured along the positive X-direction</li>
            <li>Cosine is negative for rest of the angles because the length of projection on the X-axis is measured along the negative X-direction</li>
        </ol>  

        <b>Sine is an odd function:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Consider an angle &theta;, having magnitude between 0 and 90 degrees</li>
            <li>The Sine of +&theta; is always positive since the projection on the Y-axis is always along the positive Y-direction</li>
            <li>The Sine of -&theta; is always negative since the projection on the Y-axis is always along the negative Y-direction</li>
            <li>Hence, sin(-&theta;) = -sin(&theta;): Sine is an odd function</li>
            <li>The same also holds good for an angle &theta; having magnitude between 90 and 180 degrees: Sin(&theta;) is always positive whereas sin(-&theta;) is always negative</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Cosine is an even function:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Consider an angle &theta;, having magnitude between 0 and 90 degrees</li>
            <li>The Cosine of +&theta; is always positive since the projection on the X-axis is always along the positive X-direction</li>
            <li>The Cosine of -&theta; is always positive since the projection on the X-axis is always along the positive X-direction</li>
            <li>Hence, cos(-&theta;) = cos(&theta;): Cosine is even odd function</li>
            <li>The same also holds good for an angle &theta; having magnitude between 90 and 180 degrees: Cos(&theta;) and cos(-&theta;) are both negative.</li>
