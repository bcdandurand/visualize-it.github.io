      <b>
        Ever wondered why Trigonometric functions are named the way they
        are?<br /><br />
        Why is cosine named as "co"sine, "cosecant" named as "co"secant and
        "cotangent" named as "co"tangent?<br /><br />
        Do these functions have any meaning outside of triangles?<br /><br />
        Aren't terms like "secant" and "tangent" associated with circles?

    <h5>The Age-old Brothers:<br />Sine and Cosine</h5>
    <p>
      <b>Etymology:</b> The word "sine" is derived from the latin word "Sinus"
      which means a "bay" or a "fold". It's Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian
      versions are dervided from the Greek word "khorde" which signifies a
      bow-string. In the below visualization, if we imagine the X-axis to act like a mirror, the image would become
      symmetrical. The line segments OP and OP' look like the strings of a bow, and the perpendiculars to X axis (whose
      length is equal to 2sin(&theta;)) looks like a bow
      <br /><br />

      <b>Visualization:</b> Consider a unit circle (a circle of radius 1).
      Consider a line drawn from the origin O, that makes an angle &theta;
      with the X-axis in the anti-clockwise direction. This line intersects the
      circle at a point P. The length of the projection of the line segment OP on the
      Y-axis is equal to the Sine of &theta;<br /><br />

        <p id="cos"></p>
        <p><b>Adjust angle using the following slider:</b></p>
        <div class="slidecontainer">
          <input type="range" min="0" max="360" value="30" id="slider-1" oninput="update_1('slide')"
            onchange="update_1('slide')" class="slider">
        </div>
        <p><b>Or, type the angle here:</b></p>
        <div style="width: 30%">
          <input type="number" max="360" min="0" id="type-1" value="30" oninput="update_1('typed')"
            onchange="update_1('typed')">
        </div>
      </center>
      <br />

      <b>Relationship between Sine and Cosine:</b>
    <p>
      Cosine has a serendipitous
      co-existence with Sine. The length of projection of the same line
      segment OP on the X-axis is equal to the Cosine of &theta;
    </p><br /><br />
    <h5>Deductions</h5>
    <b>The basic trigonometric identity:</b>
    \[ \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \]
    <p>Just using pythagoras theorem, we see that sin(&theta;)^2 + cos(&theta;)^2
      = 1 for all angles</p>
    <b>Value of Sines and Cosines of multiples of 90 degrees:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>The Sine of 0 degrees is 0, since a line coinciding with the X-axis has no projection on the Y-axis</li>
      <li>The Cosine of 0 degrees is 1, since a line drawn within a unit circle and coinciding with the X-axis has a
        projection of length 1 on the X-axis</li>
      <li>The Sine of 90 degrees is 1, since a line drawn within a unit circle and coinciding with the Y-axis has a
        projection of length 1 on the Y-axis</li>
      <li>The Cosine of 90 degees is 0, since a line coinciding with the Y-axis has no projection on the X-axis</li>
      <li>The same logic holds good for 180 degrees and 270 degrees</li>
      <li>This visualization also allows us to extend the definition of trigonometric functions beyond 90 degrees, since
        we are no longer restricted to a triangle</li>
    </ol>

    <b>Signs of Sine and Cosine functions:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Any angle from 0 to 180 degrees has a positive Sine, since the length of projection on the Y-axis is measured
        along the positive Y-direction</li>
      <li>Sine is negative for rest of the angles because the length of projection on the Y-axis is measured along the
        negative Y-direction</li>
      <li>Any angle from 0 to 90 degrees and 270 to 360 degrees has a positive Cosine, since the length of projection on
        the X-axis is measured along the positive X-direction</li>
      <li>Cosine is negative for rest of the angles because the length of projection on the X-axis is measured along the
        negative X-direction</li>
    </ol>

    <b>Sine is an odd function:</b>
    \[ \sin (-\theta) = - \sin (\theta) \]
    <ol>
      <li>Consider an angle &theta;, having magnitude between 0 and 90 degrees</li>
      <li>The Sine of +&theta; is always positive since the projection on the Y-axis is always along the positive
        Y-direction</li>
      <li>The Sine of -&theta; is always negative since the projection on the Y-axis is always along the negative
        Y-direction</li>
      <li>Hence, sin(-&theta;) = -sin(&theta;): Sine is an odd function</li>
      <li>The same also holds good for an angle &theta; having magnitude between 90 and 180 degrees: Sin(&theta;) is
        always positive whereas sin(-&theta;) is always negative</li>
    </ol>

    <b>Cosine is an even function:</b>
    \[ \cos (-\theta) = \cos (\theta) \]
    <ol>
      <li>Consider an angle &theta;, having magnitude between 0 and 90 degrees</li>
      <li>The Cosine of +&theta; is always positive since the projection on the X-axis is always along the positive
        X-direction</li>
      <li>The Cosine of -&theta; is always positive since the projection on the X-axis is always along the positive
        X-direction</li>
      <li>Hence, cos(-&theta;) = cos(&theta;): Cosine is even odd function</li>
      <li>The same also holds good for an angle &theta; having magnitude between 90 and 180 degrees: Cos(&theta;) and
        cos(-&theta;) are both negative</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h5>The Circle Grazers:<br>Tangent and Cotangent</h5>
    <p>
      <b>Etymology:</b> The word "tangent" comes from the Latin verb "tangere" which means "to touch"
      <br /><br />
      <b>Visualization:</b> Consider the same unit cirle with the same line segment OP. Consider a tangent drawn to the
      circle at point P. The length between the point P and the point where this tangent intersects the X-axis is equal
      to the tangent of the angle &theta;
      <br />
      <center>
        <canvas id="tan-cot"></canvas>
        <p id="angle-2"></p>
        <p id="tan"></p>
        <p id="cot"></p>
        <p><b>Adjust angle using the following slider:</b></p>
        <div class="slidecontainer">
          <input type="range" min="0" max="360" value="30" id="slider-2" oninput="update_2('slide')"
            onchange="update_2('slide')" class="slider">
        </div>
        <p><b>Or, type the angle here:</b></p>
        <div style="width: 30%">
          <input type="number" max="360" min="0" id="type-2" value="45" oninput="update_2('typed')"
            onchange="update_2('typed')">
        </div>
      </center>
      <br />
      <b>Relationship between Tangent and Cotangentt:</b>
    <p>
      The length of the same tangent, but from the point P to its
      point of intersection with the Y-axis is equal to the Cotangent of &theta;
    </p>
    <h5>Deductions</h5>

    <b>Values of Tangents and Cotangents of multiples of 90 degrees</b>
    <ol>
      <li>The Tangent of 0 degrees is 0, since the point P is already intersecting with the X-axis</li>
      <li>The Cotangent of 0 degrees is infinite, since the tangent never meets the Y-axis </li>
      <li>The Tangent of 90 degrees is infinite, since the tangent never meets the X-axis</li>
      <li>The Cotangent of 90 degrees is 0, since the point P is already intersecting with the Y-axis</li>
      <li>The same logic holds good for 180 degrees and 270 degrees</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h5>The Inner Perpetrators:<br>Secant and Cosecant</h5>
    <p>
      <b>Etymology:</b> The word "secant" is derived from the French verb "secanter" which means "to cut"
      <br /><br />
      <b>Visualization:</b> Consider the same unit cirle with the same line segment OP and the tangent drawn to the
      circle at point P. The length between the Origin and the point where the tangent intersects the X-axis is equal to
      the Secant of &theta;
      <br />
      <center>
        <canvas id="sec-cosec"></canvas>
        <p id="angle-3"></p>
        <p id="sec"></p>
        <p id="cosec"></p>
        <p><b>Adjust angle using the following slider:</b></p>
        <div class="slidecontainer">
          <input type="range" min="0" max="360" value="30" id="slider-3" oninput="update_3('slide')"
            onchange="update_3('slide')" class="slider">
        </div>
        <p><b>Or, type the angle here:</b></p>
        <div style="width: 30%">
          <input type="number" max="360" min="0" id="type-3" value="60" oninput="update_3('typed')"
            onchange="update_3('typed')">
        </div>
      </center>
      <br />
      <b>Relationship between Secant and Cosecant:</b>
    <p>
      The distance between the Origin and the point where the same tangent intersects the Y-axis is equal to the
      Cosecant of &theta;
    </p>
    <h5>Deductions</h5>
    <b>Trigonometric identities:</b>
    <p>On applying Pythagoras theorem to the two traingles, we obtain:</p>
    \[ 1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta \]
    \[ 1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta \]
    <b>Values of Secant and Cosecant of multiples of 90 degrees</b>
    <ol>
      <li>The Secant of 0 degrees is 1, since the point P coincides with the X-axis</li>
      <li>The Cosecant of 0 degrees is infinite, since the tangent never meets the Y-axis</li>
      <li>The Secant of 90 degrees is infinite, since the tangent never meets the X-axis</li>
      <li>The Cosecant of 0 degrees is 1, since the point P coincides with the Y-axis</li>
      <li>The same logic holds good for 180 degrees and 270 degrees</li>
