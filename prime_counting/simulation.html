    <h4>Graphing the Prime Counting Function</h4>

    <p>
        The prime counting function &pi;(x) outputs the number of prime numbers between 1 and x inclusive. Although the
        distribution of prime is seemingly random, as x tends to larger natural numbers, &pi;(x) takes an increasingly
        linear form, as can be discerned from the below graph. The main reason that explains the hype around Riemann
        Hypothesis is that it's proof will provide us with insights into distribution of prime numbers.

    <h5>Trivia</h5>
    <p>
        The distribution of prime numbers has been of central interest to mathematicians, purely due to recreational
        reasons. The prime counting function (often denoted as &pi;(x)) has been numerically graphed here. As the limit
        tends to infinite, it is observed that &pi;(x) takes on an increasinsly linear form. Several
        logarithmic functions and integrals are known to approximate it. It is well-known that the sequence of prime
        numbers is infinite, merely because the number obtained by adding 1 to the product of known primes is a prime
        number (due to its very method of construction).
