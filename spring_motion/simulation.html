  <h4>Simulation of Spring Motion</h4>
  <p>Spring motion belongs to a subset of periodic motion known as Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), where the restoring
    force is directly proportional to the objects displacement magnitude and acts towards the objects equilibrium
    position. The proportionality factor between restoring force and displacement plays a key role in determining the
    time period of motion. It is commonly denoted by &omega;^2.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a spring, &omega;^2 is given by k/m. Where 'k' is known as spring constant. It is the
    magnitude ofrestoring force developed for unit displacement of the edge of the spring from its equilibrium position.
    In essence, it quantifies the 'stiffness' of the spring. 'm' is mass of the spring.
  </p>
  <p>
    The time period of SHM is universally given by \( \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \). For a spring, \( T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}} \). Frequency of
    vibration is given by \( \frac{1}{T} \). For a spring, \( f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \). Hence, a lighter but stiffer spring oscillates
    faster than a heavier but looser spring. In the below interactive simulation, increase 'k' or decrease 'm' and
    observe what happens to the frequency of oscillation:

  <b>Relationship of SHM with sines and cosine:</b><br>
  <p>
    Any periodic function can be expressed as a superposition of sines and cosine. Fourier transformation deals with
    determining this superposition for a given periodic function. However, in the case of SHM (under non-dissipative
    conditions), this relationship is hard to miss. Perform the above simulation with a damping constant of 0 and
    observe the cosine wave being generated.
  </p>
  <b>Types of vibrations:</b>
  <p>
    Setting damping constant as 0 gives us natural vibrations whereas an non-zero damping constant gives us damped
    vibrations.
  </p>
  <b>Idealisations:</b>
  <p>
    In the real world, resistive forces are always present. Hence, vibrations are always damped. Moreover, since Hooke's
    law is not valid outside elastic limits, the relationship between restoring force 'F' and displacement from mean position
    'x' becomes non-linear.
  </p>
  <b>Notes:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Fully compatible with SI units</li>
    <li>By convention, measurements to the right of the central line is taken positive whereas measurements to the left of the central line are regarded to be negative. Hence, a positive position and negative velocity implies that the edge of spring is towards the right of the central line but moving towards the left</li>
    <li>Precision of 2 is ideal. Precision of 1 is associated with less accuracy and greater frequencies. If precision is greater 2, the simulation becomes slower because more computation is involved per cycle</li>
    <li>Simulation may lag on lower-end desktops and mobile phones</li>
