  <h2>Bezier Curves</h2>
  <center>
    <p>
      A Bezier curve is a parametric curve used widely in designing and computer graphics. It was first used by French
      engineer Pierre Bezier in the 1960s. A bezier curve is generated through the process of recursive linear
      interpolation of control points. All text on computers are rendered as Bezier curves, since it is more efficient
      to store a bunch of coordinates than to store the coordinates of all pixels involved.

  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>
    Linear interpolation between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is a process of uniformly tracing the
    space between them. To be more mathematical, it involves varying a parameter, say \(t\), from 0 to 1, in the
    following equations:
    \[ x = x_1 + t (x_2 - x_1) \]
    \[ y = y_1 + t (y_2 - y_1) \]
    The line traced by the point \((x, y)\) as \(t\) varies from 0 to 1 is called a linear interpolation. At \(t = 0\),
    the line begins from \((x_1, y_1)\). At \(t = 1\), the line ends at \((x_2, y_2)\).
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us consider the case of just two points. Then linear interpolation between them will just generate a straight
    line connecting the two points. The red dot is the initial point whereas the blue dot is the final point.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, add another point. This point fits in between the initial and final point. We consider (but won't draw) a line
    between the 1st and 2nd point, and a line between the 2nd and 3rd point. Interpolating between these two lines and
    joining the interpolated points will give us a moving line. When interpolation takes place between the two lines, we
    also interpolate the resulting line, and trace the interpolated point. This gives us a quadratic bezier curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, with \(n\) points, we get \(n-1\) lines by interpolation. We interpolate between these lines to get
    \(n-2\) lines and so on. Until we arrive at only one interpolated line. Tracing it's interpolation gives us the
    corresponding Bezier curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    It might be hard to understand the working of a Bezier curve using just textual description. In this case, fret not.
    A lot of videos are available online (I would recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw"
      target="_blank">this one</a>). This website just allows you to play with Bezier curves.
