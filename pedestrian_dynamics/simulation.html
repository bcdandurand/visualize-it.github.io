    <h3>Phenomena</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Lane formation:</b> Eventually, the boids will forms lanes such that all boids in the same lane are
        travelling in the same direction. Lane formation happens because boids keep steering away from boids coming in
        the opposite direction, until they reach a state wherein they no longer encounter opposing boids (that is, in
        a lane). A critical number of boids is required for lane formation, below which there is just not enough
        interaction to faciliate lane formation. The size of the "privacy zone" also plays a role here. The number of
        lanes possible depends on the width of the pathway. If there is a bias in direction, then the minority boids
        may take longer to form their own lanes. A high variance in walking speed impedes the formation of lanes, as
        described in the next point.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <b>Phantom traffic jams:</b> A congestion is called a phantom traffic jam if there was no long-term inertial
        cause (example: vehicle break down, obstacles on road, etc) behind it. They typically happen because vehicles
        decelerates too much (to take a turn, to avoid coming too close to the front vehicle, etc), which causes the
        vehicle behind it to decelerate, and so on. This causes a "shockwave" of deceleration to travel backwards and is
        resolved only when the last car in the chain can safely chose not to decelerate. In this simulation, phantom
        traffic jams are caused when there is high variance in speed. The faster boids will have to decelerate and turn
        in order to get ahead of the slower boids, and this obstructs the movement of the surrounding boids. This also
        obstructs formation of lanes. In real-life, however, phantom traffic jams are mostly associated with vehicles
        (not pedestrians) and they happen in laned roads/highways.

    <b>Note:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>The model in this simulation is inspired from <a
          href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282" target="_blank">this paper</a>.</li>
      <li>The boundary condition is periodic. However, interactions don't happen across the boundary. This is to
        simulate the effect of entering a new road.</li>
      <li>If all boids are moving in same direction, and if variance is maximized, then flow decreases. This effect is
        more pronounced at higher densities. This observation has been vaguely connected to phantom traffic jams.</li>
      <li>Boids also steer away from the boundaries</li>
      <li>This simulation may lag on lower end devices</li>
