  <h4>Planetary Motion</h4>
  <p>The Universal Law of Gravitation states that every body in this universe attracts the other by virtue of its mass,
    The force of attraction being directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the
    square of the distance of their separation. The equation F = Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>2</sup> is the
    numerical form of this law. The aforementioned law was first published by Sir Isaac Newton in 1687.</p>

    <li><b>Unstable orbit:</b> Here, the planet's total energy is actually positive. Hence it is not actually bound to
      the star and instead revolves around an unstable orbit before getting ejected. Moreover, the planet is only
      10 times lighter than the star, causing the star to wobble.

      <b>Binary system:</b> Two equally heavy bodies orbiting their center of mass. This sort of behaviour is usually
      seen among stars. Alpha Centauri A and B are well-known examples, just 4.36 light years away from Earth. However,
      another star named Proxima Centauri actually orbits the binary system!

      <b>Planetary dance:</b> The two planets initially revolve symmetrically around the star. However, they come quite
      close
      four times and exchange energy during each interaction. The planet that continually loses energy occupies
      a lower orbit and eventually gets ejected whereas the planet that continually gains energy settles in an highly
      elliptical orbit.

  <b>The Force of Gravity:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>As a result of Newton's 3rd law of motion, the gravitational force of attraction of body
      A on body B is equal to that of body B on body A.</li>
    <li>G is an universal constant whose value is known to be 6.67 * 10<sup>-11</sup>
      m<sup>3</sup>kg<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-2</sup></li>
    <li>As stated before, gravitational force acts between all pairs of objects in this universe by virtue of their
      mass. However, we don't see everyday objects getting attracted to each other because the product of their masses
      is not high enough to dwarf the low value of G. Hence, the force of gravity between them is too low to cause any
      observable effects.</li>
    <li>Although it is a well-known fact that electromagnetic force is 10<sup>38</sup> times stronger than gravitational
      force, electromagnetic force cannot be dominant in the universe due to the presence of two types of charge. Over
      large volumes, these two types of charges cancel out each other, thereby nullifying any electromagnetic
      interactions. Moreover, electromagnetic interactions can be attractive as well as repulsive. On the other hand,
      there is only one type of mass, hence there is no repulsive gravitational interaction and no mass cancellation
      throughout the entire expanse of the universe, thereby allowing gravity to pervade it.</li>
    <li>The motion of celestial bodies is directed by the force of gravity alone. Their huge masses allows high degree
      of gravitational interaction despite the large distances between them.</li>

  </ol>

  <b>The Gravitational Field:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Physicists often use the concept of a gravitational field being generated around a mass. The strength of the
      gravitational field at a point in the vicinity of a mass is proportional to the mass 'M' of the object and falls
      as the square of distance of separation 'r'. It is numerically denoted by GM/r<sup>2</sup></li>
    <li>Any body of mass 'm', when kept in this field, interacts with it. The strength of interaction being proportional
      to 'm' and to the strength of the gravitational field.</li>
    <li>The postulation of a field is not merely theoretical. Infact, it is known that the bounds of this field explands
      at the speed of light. Moreover, the concents of fields and potentials convey the transfer of energy and momentum
      in an elegant manner.</li>
  </ol>

  <b>Gravitational Potential</b>
  <ol>
    <li>When two bodies are gravitationally interacting with one another, some energy is required to separate them until the
      gravitational force of attraction between them becomes negligible. This energy, but for a unit mass, is defined to
      be the gravitational potential.</li>
    <li>The gravitational potential at a point 'r' units away from a mass 'M' is defined to be -GM/r whereas the
      potential energy of a mass 'm' placed at this point is defined to be -GMm/r</li>
    <li>The negative sign denotes that 1) energy is required to separate them or 2) the bodies are bound to each other
    </li>
    <li>The total mechanical energy as a result of gravitational interaction between two objects is equal to the sum of
      their kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy.</li>
  </ol>

  <b>Kepler's Laws</b>
  <ol>
    <li>In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler postulated three laws that were followed by orbiting planets. These laws
      were obtained by analysis of planetary data recorded by Tycho Brahe with the assistance of Kepler. They lacked any
      scientific backing when they were proposed.</li>
    <li>The first law states that planets revolve around their star in elliptical orbits, wherein the star is situated
      at one of the foci. An ellipse is the locus of a point such that the sum of their distance from two fixed points
      is always constant. In theory, a circle is an ellipse obtained by a merger of these two points. This law is a
      result of the nature of gravitational force itself.</li>
    <li>The second law states that planets trace equal areas in equal intervals of time. This indirectly means that
      planets in non-circular orbits must move faster when closer to the star. This can be observed in the default
      simulation above. This law is a result of conservation of angular momentum</li>
    <li>The third law states that the square of time period of revolution of a planet around its star is directly
      proportional to the cube of the major axis. This law can be derived with a bit of algebra.</li>
  </ol>

  <b> General info about stellar systems</b>
  <ol>
    <li>It is a false notion that all planets revolve around their star. The planets and the star revolve around the
      center of mass of the stellar system. Due to the fact that stars tend to be much more massive than all the
      revolving planets combined, this center of mass often tends to be within the star and maybe very close to the
      center of the star, therefore giving the appearance that the planets actually revolve around the star.</li>
    <li>Planets are usually formed from a disk of rocks and gases found around the protostar. Since a disk is planar,
      all the resulting planets tend to orbit the star in the same plane, with small deviations.</li>
  </ol>

  <b>Note:</b>
  <ol>
    <li>The above simulation is not compatible with SI units. The value of G is taken to be 1, in order to avoid working
      with huge masses and astronomical distances</li>
    <li>Stars and Planets in the above simulation are treated equally. This allows us to observe the wobbling of the
      star when the revolving planets are not many orders lighter than the star.</li>
    <li>The above simulation doesn't check and allow collissions between bodies. Because of this, ejection of planets is
      a very common occurence in the simulation although it rarely takes place in reality.</li>
  </ol>
