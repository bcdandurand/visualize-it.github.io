  <h4>Simulation of Unbiased Random Walks</h4>
  <br>
  <p>
    This simulation aims to show the connection between unbiased random walks and normal distribution. It also showcases
    the relationship between Standard deviation, Mean squared displacement and number of steps. An animal which has
    equal probability of moving towards the left or towards the right, is said to execute an unbiased random walk.

      Mean is expected to be around 0, standard deviation around &Sqrt;N and MSD around N

  <h5>Resemblance with Normal distribution</h5>

  <p>
    The probability of an animal reaching a particular point can be modelled as a binomial distribution. Due to the
    Central Limit Theorem - as the sample size increases, the distribution becomes more similar to a normal
    distribution. Another way to look at it is via Pascal's triangle. The N-th row of Pascal's triangle (where N is the
    number of steps) has N elements. The values are the middle are greater than the values at the ends. To put it in
    more concrete terms - the entry at a particular point on Pascal's triangle shows the number of steps one can take to
    reach it. Hence more animals end up at the middle than at the extremes.

  <h5>Parameters and their Formulae</h5>

  <p>
    <b>1) Mean: </b> since an animal is equally likely to go left or right, the mean position of an animal is expected to be zero.
    <br>
    <b>2) Mean Squared Displacement: </b> MSD is the mean of the square of displacements. It is calculated to be Na<sup>2</sup>, where 'a' is the displacement in one step (a = 1 in our case) and 'N' is the number of steps. Hence MSD = N. 
    <br>
    <b>3) Standard Deviation: </b> is given by &Sqrt;(MSD - Mean<sup>2</sup>). Evaluates to &Sqrt;N in our case
  </p>
  <p>
    The more animals we consider, the greater agreement we find between our measured and expected parameters.
